"Data Breach Procedures"

Description: This epic involves defining the procedures for handling data breaches, including identifying potential breaches, notifying data subjects and regulators, and minimizing the impact of the breach.

Goals: 
    To have a clear process for identifying and responding to data breaches
    To minimize the impact of a data breach on our business and our customers
    To comply with GDPR requirements for data breach notifications

User Stories: As a data subject, I want to be notified in a timely manner if my personal data is involved in a data breach, so that I can take appropriate steps to protect myself.

Dependencies:
    The availability of incident response team members to quickly respond to a data breach.
    The identification and categorization of the data being collected and processed, to ensure that appropriate notifications are made in the event of a breach.
    The implementation of appropriate security measures to prevent and detect data breaches.

Risks: 
    Delayed notifications to data subjects and regulators - To mitigate this risk, we will develop clear and concise notification procedures and train incident response team members on how to use them effectively.
    Incomplete or inaccurate information in breach notifications - To mitigate this risk, we will develop a standardized breach notification template and train incident response team members on how to complete it accurately.
    Lack of availability of incident response team members - To mitigate this risk, we will have backup incident response team members available and ready to respond in case of an emergency.

Estimated Effort: 4 weeks

Business Value: This epic delivers significant business value by ensuring that we have a clear process for identifying and responding to data breaches, minimizing the impact on our business and our customers, and complying with GDPR requirements.

Priority: High priority.
