"Centralized Logging and Monitoring"

Description: Implement a centralized logging and monitoring solution to collect and analyze logs and metrics from infrastructure and applications.

Goals: 
    Provide visibility into infrastructure and application health
    Detect and diagnose issues quickly
    Facilitate compliance and auditing requirements

User Stories: 
    As a DevOps Engineer, I want to configure log collection and aggregation for infrastructure resources, so that I can monitor and troubleshoot issues.
    As a Developer, I want to integrate application logging with the centralized logging solution, so that I can monitor application behavior.
    As a Security Analyst, I want to use the centralized logging solution to detect and alert on potential security threats, so that I can ensure compliance and security.

Dependencies: Infrastructure as Code must be implemented to deploy and configure resources.

Risks: Lack of proper monitoring and logging may lead to longer time to detect and resolve issues, and may result in security incidents.

Estimated Effort: 4-6 sprints

Business Value: Improved visibility, security and compliance of infrastructure and applications

Priority: Medium
