As a Developer, I want to integrate my code changes into the CI/CD pipeline, so that I can automate the build and test process.

Acceptance Criteria:

The code changes can be integrated into the existing CI/CD pipeline without causing any conflicts or issues with the existing codebase.
The CI/CD pipeline should be triggered automatically when a new code change is pushed to the repository.
The build process should be automated and should include all necessary steps for building the code, such as compiling, linking, and packaging.
The test process should be automated and should include all necessary steps for testing the code, such as unit tests, integration tests, and end-to-end tests.
The results of the build and test process should be logged and made available to the development team.
The CI/CD pipeline should be scalable and able to handle increased load as the codebase grows in size and complexity.
The CI/CD pipeline should be secure and comply with all relevant security standards and best practices.
