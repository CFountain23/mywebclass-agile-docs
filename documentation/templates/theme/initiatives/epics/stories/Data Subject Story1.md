As an IT Specialist, I want to ensure that the incident response plan includes appropriate technical measures, such as data backup and recovery procedures, so that data loss is minimized.

Acceptance Criteria:
    The incident response plan includes a data backup and recovery strategy that outlines how data will be backed up and restored in the event of an incident.
    The data backup and recovery strategy includes a backup schedule and identifies the type of data that will be backed up, such as databases, applications, or files.
    The data backup and recovery strategy identifies where backups will be stored, such as on-premise or in the cloud, and how backups will be secured.
    The incident response plan includes procedures for testing data backups to ensure they are functional and can be restored successfully.
    The incident response plan outlines procedures for restoring data in the event of an incident, including who is responsible for performing the restore and how long the process is expected to take.
    The incident response plan includes procedures for communicating with stakeholders, such as customers or employees, about the incident and any impacts to their data.
    The incident response plan includes procedures for conducting a post-incident review to identify areas for improvement and update the plan accordingly.
    The technical measures in the incident response plan align with industry best practices and any applicable regulatory requirements, such as GDPR or HIPAA.
