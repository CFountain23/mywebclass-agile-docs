As a DevOps Engineer, I want to version control my infrastructure code, so that I can easily rollback and audit changes.

Acceptance Criteria:

The infrastructure code is stored in a version control system such as Git, Bitbucket or GitHub.
Each change to the infrastructure code is tracked and committed with a meaningful commit message and author.
The version control system is integrated with the Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipeline.
The CI/CD pipeline is triggered automatically when changes to the infrastructure code are committed and pushed to the repository.
The CI/CD pipeline performs automated testing and validation of the infrastructure code changes.
The CI/CD pipeline automatically deploys the changes to the staging environment for further testing and validation.
The CI/CD pipeline automatically deploys the changes to the production environment after passing all tests and validation.
The DevOps Engineer can easily rollback changes to the infrastructure code if necessary.
The version control system provides an audit trail of all changes to the infrastructure code.
