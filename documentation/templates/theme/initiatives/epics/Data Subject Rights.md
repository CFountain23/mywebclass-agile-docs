"Data Subject Rights"

Description: This epic involves defining the procedures for handling data breaches, including identifying key personnel responsible for handling breaches, creating an incident response plan, and providing clear communication to data subjects and regulators in the event of a breach.

Goals: 
    To ensure that the organization has a clear process for handling data breaches in compliance with GDPR law
    To minimize the impact of data breaches on data subjects and the organization
    To mitigate legal and reputational risks associated with data breaches

User Stories: As an IT Specialist, I want to ensure that the incident response plan includes appropriate technical measures, such as data backup and recovery procedures, so that data loss is minimized.

Dependencies: 
    Review and Update Privacy Policy Epic - Procedures for handling data breaches will need to be aligned with the updated privacy policy.
    Define Procedures for Handling Data Subject Rights Epic - Procedures for handling data breaches will need to be aligned with the procedures for handling data subject requests.

Risks: 
    Delayed response to a data breach - To mitigate this risk, the incident response plan will be regularly reviewed and updated, and key personnel will receive regular training on their roles and responsibilities.
    Insufficient technical measures to prevent data loss - To mitigate this risk, the incident response plan will include appropriate technical measures, such as data backup and recovery procedures.
    Inadequate communication to data subjects and regulators - To mitigate this risk, clear communication protocols will be developed and tested in advance of any data breach.

Estimated Effort: 6-8 weeks

Business Value: This epic will provide a clear process for handling data breaches in compliance with GDPR law, minimizing the impact of data breaches on data subjects and the organization, and mitigating legal and reputational risks associated with data breaches.
