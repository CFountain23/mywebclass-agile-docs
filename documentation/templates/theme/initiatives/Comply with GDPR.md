"Comply with GDPR"

Description: This initiative is aimed at ensuring that our website complies with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) law, which is a data protection regulation in the European Union (EU).

Goals: 
    To ensure that our website complies with GDPR law
    To protect the privacy rights of our website visitors
    To avoid any legal consequences of non-compliance with GDPR law

Scope:
    The initiative will cover the following areas:
        Data collection and processing policies 
        Cookie policies and consent
        Privacy policy
        Data subject rights
        Procedures for handling data breaches
Outcomes: 
    A website that complies with GDPR law
    Enhanced privacy protection for website visitors
    Mitigated legal risks associated with non-compliance with GDPR law

Deliverables: 
    Updated data collection and processing policies
    Updated cookie policies and consent forms
    Updated privacy policy
    Procedures for handling data subject rights
    Procedures for handling data breaches

Milestones: 
    Research and analysis - 2 weeks

    Implementation of new policies and procedures - 4 weeks

Constraints: 
    Limited budget for external legal support
    Limited internal resources for implementing new policies and procedures
    Time constraints due to the urgency of compliance with GDPR law

Assumptions: 
    The legal requirements for GDPR compliance are clear and straightforward
    The website's current data collection and processing policies are compliant with GDPR law to some extent

Risks:
    Legal penalties for non-compliance - To mitigate this risk, we will seek legal advice and conduct thorough research to ensure full compliance with GDPR law.
    Negative impact on website traffic and user experience - To mitigate this risk, we will ensure that our new policies and procedures are clearly communicated to website visitors, and that we provide a user-friendly experience for updating cookie consent and accessing privacy policies.
    Insufficient internal resources to implement new policies and procedures - To mitigate this risk, we will prioritize tasks and allocate sufficient resources for each task.
